# clojure-org-table-tests

This is a test of Clojure source code blocks in emacs org-mode.
The primary file is the PDF file.  The code blocks were wrapped in 
begin_example/end_example so that the exports would show the actual
entries into the org file.

The file demonstrates numerous permutations of the :results header options.
Both Clojure and Python code blocks were included for comparison.
